Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Timesheet total hours for maintenance requests becomes stored => this could
  be directly proposed to OCA as a ``maintenance_timesheet`` improvement.
* Request field for a timesheet becomes indexed => this could be directly
  proposed to OCA as a ``maintenance_timesheet`` improvement. 
* Timesheet edition is still slow, maybe because request lock revision.
